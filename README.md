Minimal STM32 F4 Breakoutboard with USB-C and 10-pin SWD port.

STM32 NUCLEO boards do not have 10-pin SWD port and you are stuck with the provided ST-Link interface. I like using the BlackMagic GDB probe for development. https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic Checkout their amesome embeddded GDB server.

I think all projects should be using USB-C. I'm still running it in USB 2.0 mode. But the USB-C connector is the one to go with.
